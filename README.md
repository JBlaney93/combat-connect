## Getting Started
Once you clone the repository, you will need to run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.  
When you pull the repository there will now be an empty database included.  
For instructions on how to make changes, see the Trello for info. The commands to generate and run database migrations are in the package.json.  

When you are ready ``` npm run dev ``` to run the development server on localhost:3000.
