## Getting Started
Once you clone the repository, you will need to run ```npm install``` to install dependencies.  
When you pull the repository there will now be an empty database included.  
  
If the database isn't empty, or you would like to sanitise the data, delete the sqlite.db file and run the following commands:  
```npm run generate```  
```npm run migrate```  
These commands are also in the package.json for reference.  


For instructions on how to make changes to the database schema, see the Trello for info.

When you are ready ``` npm run dev ``` to run the development server on localhost:3000.
